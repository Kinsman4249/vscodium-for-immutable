# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent release receives security fixes, regardless of version number. Older releases, including older major versions, are not backported.

| Version         | Supported          |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Latest release  | :white_check_mark: |
| Anything older  | :x:                |

If you need a fix and you're on an older release, upgrade to the latest release first.

This policy assumes a solo maintainer, which is the normal setup for these projects. If a project grows into a team effort with users who genuinely need multiple supported release lines, this file can be adapted to add a longer support window instead.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue in this project, **please do not file a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, open a private GitHub Security Advisory:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/Kinsman4249/vscodium-for-immutable/security) of this repository.
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Provide as much detail as possible: affected version, reproduction steps, impact, and any suggested mitigation.

You should receive an acknowledgment within a few business days. If the issue is confirmed, a fix will be developed privately and released as a patch version. You'll be credited in the release notes (or anonymously, if you prefer).

## Scope

In-scope:

- Vulnerabilities in any code or scripts shipped by this project
- Insecure default configurations written by this project's setup / install code
- Any path that could allow privilege escalation or unauthorized access to credentials managed by this project

Out of scope:

- Vulnerabilities in upstream dependencies - please report those to the dependency's own maintainers
- Vulnerabilities in third-party services this project integrates with - report those to the service directly
- General hardening suggestions for your own host or environment (use a feature request issue instead)
